## Getting help and support

If you are having difficulty using this SDK, or working with the RingCentral API, please visit
our [developer community forums](https://community.ringcentral.com/index.html) for help and to get quick answers to
your questions. If you wish to contact the RingCentral Developer Support team directly,
please [submit a help ticket](https://developers.ringcentral.com/support/create-case) from our developer website.

## Installation

This SDK is tested against JDK 11 so we recommend using the same. Earlier versions such as Java 8 should work as well,
please report issues if you encounter any.

### Gradle

```groovy
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  implementation 'com.ringcentral:ringcentral:[version]'
}
```

Don't forget to replace `[version]` with expected version. You can find the latest versions
in [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:ringcentral).

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.ringcentral</groupId>
  <artifactId>ringcentral</artifactId>
  <version>[version]</version>
</dependency>
```

Don't forget to replace `[version]` with expected version. You can find the latest versions
in [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:ringcentral).

### Manually

[Download jar here](https://search.maven.org/classic/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22ringcentral%22) and save it into your
java classpath.

## Usage

### Initialization & Authorization Using jwtToken

```java
RestClient rc = new RestClient(clientId, clientSecret, server);
rc.authorize(jwtToken);

// do something with `rc`

rc.revoke();
```

#### Below are some pointers which help to understand the JWT authorization flow

* [JWT authorization code flow](https://developers.ringcentral.com/guide/authentication/jwt-flow)
* [Configuring apps to use JWT](https://developers.ringcentral.com/guide/authentication/jwt/config-app)
* [CreateJWT](https://developers.ringcentral.com/guide/getting-started/create-credential)

For the `server` parameter, there are two static final string variables in `RestClient`:

```java
public static final String PRODUCTION_SERVER = "https://platform.ringcentral.com";
```

### What is a Client ID and Client Secret used for?

Each app you build must first be registered in the RingCentral Developer Console. Upon doing so, you will receive a
Client ID and Client Secret that together uniquely identify your application on our platform. A public app could be used
by many companies while a private app can only be used by your current company.

### Token refresh

Since 1.0 version, the SDK by default does NOT do auto token refresh.
This is because most of the time it's better to manage token lifecycle manually: `rc.refresh()`.

For simple apps, token auto refresh could be beneficial. So we provide a sugar method: `rc.autoRefresh()`.
This method will start a background timer to refresh token for you every 30 minutes.
You can customize the refresh period, for example, change it to every 50 minutes: `rc.autoRefresh(1000 * 60 * 50)`.

## Code samples

You can find [sample code for all the endpoints](./samples.md).

There is also lots of useful code for your reference in our [test cases](./src/test/java/com/ringcentral).

## Logging

The logging is implemented according
to [Java Logging Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/core/java-logging-overview.htm)

To enable printing log to the console:

```java
RestClient.logger.setLevel(Level.FINE);
```

For more log output channels, please refer
to [Handlers](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/core/java-logging-overview.htm#GUID-B83B652C-17EA-48D9-93D2-563AE1FF8EDA__HANDLERS-4D023767)
.

## Binary content downloading

Some [sample code](./samples.md) for binary content downloading may not work.

Because RingCentral is gradually migrating binary content to CDN such as `media.ringcentral.com`.

For example, to download the attachment of a fax:

```java
// `message` is the fax message object
byte[] content = rc.get<byte[]>(message.attachments[0].uri).bytes();
```

The following does **NOT** work:

```java
// `message` is the fax message object
byte[] content = rc.restapi().account().extension().messageStore(message.id).content(message.attachments[0].id).get();
```

### Rule of thumb

But not all binary content has been migrated to CDN.
If the resource to download provides you with a CDN uri, use that CDN uri.
If there is no CDN uri provided, construct the uri as the [sample code](./samples.md) shows.

## Subscriptions & notifications

### WebSocket

Please refer to the [RingCentral WebSocket SDK for Java](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-websocket-java)
project.

### (Deprecated) PubNub

Please refer to the [RingCentral PubNub SDK for Java](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-pubnub-java) project.

## Release Notes

### 3.0.0

We have renamed all "glip" to "team-messaging/v1". For example:

```java
rc.restapi().glip()...
```

becomes

```java
rc.teamMessaging().v1()...
```

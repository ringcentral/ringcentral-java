     * Replaces the user device with another device, which is assigned to an extension
     * or is stored in the inventory of the same account.
     * Currently, the following device types can be swapped - `HardPhone` and `OtherPhone`.
     * <p>
     * Please note:
     * <p>
     * - This method allows replacing a device itself, while a phone number,
     * a digital Line and an emergency address associated with this device remain unchanged
     * and will still work together in a chain with the replacement device.
     * - If a target device is from the inventory, then a source device will be moved
     * to the inventory, and a target device will be assigned to the current extension.
     * - If a target device is currently assigned to another extension,
     * then the devices will be just swapped.
